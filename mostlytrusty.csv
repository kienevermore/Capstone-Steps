Despite the yearlong dislocations and the saturation media coverage, the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic will soon recede, more likely than not, and fade like painted advertisements on brick walls, leaving behind only a flicker of the current terror. We will nod gravely when reminded of the losses suffered and share the stories of friends and family who died too soon. But in the absence of a media prompt or other reminder, we will sequester the Covid-19 pandemic in history books and refer to it mostly when fresh viral eruptions strike. We will forget about it."

The Hard Truth About Memorializing the Pandemic,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/02/23/the-hard-truth-about-memorializing-the-pandemic-471197,"But these acts of commemoration aren’t likely to lead to permanent monuments where we gather for reflection. By convention, we erect most of our monuments to salute the heroic spirit, or acknowledge acts of sacrifice of statue-genic soldiers, police, and firefighters or illustrate national ideals, such as the Statue of Liberty or the Gateway Arch. Since the 9/11 attacks especially, first responders have deservedly acquired heroic stature they never possessed before, so we can expect that the medical responders—from doctors to janitors—who died from Covid-19 might be memorialized in granite sometime this decade. But the other 500,000? Even if they struggled heroically for their lives on their deathbeds, we’re not likely to formally institutionalize the memory of their passing because it’s not our way. We quickly forgot the influenza pandemic of 1918, recalling most palpably only when similar viral threats surfaced in 1957, 1976 and 2003, but then put the deaths out of mind as the crises passed. Our stinginess about building shrines to honor of people who died from disease is illustrated by our reaction to the AIDS catastrophe. The AIDS quilt marked the deaths from that epidemic in the late 1980s, touring 20 cities. (As of last year, the quilt had grown to 1.2 million square feet and is stored in an Oakland, Calif., warehouse.) Yet no permanent monument to the 700,000 Americans (and counting) to die from that virus exists, although an initiative to build such a place has taken root in Southern California."

Also, the disease moved quickly through the population and vanished before its full danger could be realized. Polio or smallpox, which killed and left visible traces on its survivors to remind people of its power, conveyed greater fear. “No one ever took years to die of flu,” Crosby writes, and most of the stricken survived. Finally, few if any famous individuals died from the flu, so the press did not memorialize its many martyrs in large type."

Barry reports in his book, The Great Influenza, which complicates any attempt to fully analogize the two outbreaks. When the flu finally passed, it took with it many of the memories associated with it, leaving only a cultural blank behind. Only two monuments to the flu appear to have been erected, and they were latecomers: a Barre, Vt., granite bench in 2018 and a New Zealand plaque in 2019. Such novelists as Wallace Stegner, Willa Cather, Thomas Wolfe, John O’Hara, Mary McCarthy, and William Maxwell touched on the topic in their fiction, but F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway steered wide of the disaster. The only writer of note to witness the influenza pandemic of 1918 and address it at length was Katherine Anne Porter, but then only in an autobiographical novella published in 1939. Famous historians largely passed over the topic in their college textbooks, too, Crosby adds, and the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature devoted more column inches to baseball than it did the flu in its 1919-1921 index. Tellingly, Dr. William Carlos Williams, who conducted 60 medical calls a day as the pandemic raged, never exploited the virus for his poetry."

The Kingdom does not face a credible threat of a large-scale conventional attack by Iran or any other countries in the region.
